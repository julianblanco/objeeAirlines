% The coordinate system used in this model is defined as follows:
% X: pointing forward, Roll axis
% Y: pointing to the right, Pitch axis
% Z: pointing down, Yaw axis
% To define the geometry of the airframe, the following convention is used:
% - the base airframe is assumed to be somewhat symmetric
% - the CoG for the base airframe coincides with the geometric center in X/Y plane (but is shifted along Z axis)
% - the motor arm length in X/Y plane is defined as the distance to the geometric center of the base airframe
% - motor thrust is generated at the prop, which is offset a distance (along Z) from the geometric center
% - motor thrust vector may be misaligned from purely Z direction, so a set of rotation angles is given for each motor
% - real position of CoG is given as a position vector from geometric center
% - everything is expressed in body coordinate system described above

We use coocox and the ARM code is prepared with (previous) version 1.7.8, which you can download from   http://www.coocox.org/software/coide.php  
 
Also I want to inform you that besides the TREK source code we also have basic functionality example code available as the TREK/EVK source code would have a lot of code required for the EVK/TREK boards, but not necessarily for what you want to use the code for. This code is called: DW1000 Application Programming Interface with application examples and can be downloaded from: http://www.decawave.com/.
